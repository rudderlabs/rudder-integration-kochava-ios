## Integrating Kochava with RudderStack's iOS SDK

[Kochava](https://www.kochava.com/) offers mobile app attribution and mobile app analytics providing holistic, unbiased measurement for precise, real-time visualization of app performance through the funnel.

1. Add Kochava as destination from Rudder Dashboard and fill in the required details.

2. Rudder-Kochava is available through [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org). To install it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod 'Rudder-Kochava'
```

## Initialize ```RudderClient```

Put this code in your ```AppDelegate.m``` file under the method ```didFinishLaunchingWithOptions```
```
RSConfigBuilder *builder = [[RSConfigBuilder alloc] init];
[builder withDataPlaneUrl:DATA_PLANE_URL];
[builder withFactory:[RudderKochavaFactory instance]];
[RSClient getInstance:WRITE_KEY config:[builder build]];
```

## Send Events
